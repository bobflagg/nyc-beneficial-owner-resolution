"""CONNECTED_BY_DEED — the ACRIS multi-parcel-deed co-ownership edge (name-free veil-pierce).

Buildings conveyed on ONE ACRIS deed share a grantee, so they have the same owner — regardless of
what their individual LLCs are named. This is the ONLY signal that pierces the sophisticated shell
game (one owner, many differently-named single-purpose LLCs): name-anchored Splink and the exact
registered-LLC edge both keep those LLCs apart, but a shared deed proves them one owner. Validated
on PF-...739 (Williamsburg): it merged a 22-building bundle spanning 17 different LLC names, and the
"175 REALTY ASSOCIATES I/II/IV" numbered shells — links nothing else in the KG could make.

A SPECIALIST signal, by design: most buildings are bought individually (own deed), so it is sparse
(only the co-conveyed portfolios link). It feeds the OWNERSHIP layer only (owner_groups reads
CONNECTED_BY_SPLINK|CONNECTED_BY_DEED), never the address-network Portfolio — deeds are ownership
evidence, not an operational network.

STALENESS GUARD — use each building's LATEST deed, not any deed. Two buildings are grouped only when
their *most recent* conveyance is the SAME multi-parcel deed: if a building was co-bought long ago
but never re-sold, that old deed is still its latest, so the co-ownership stands (captures PF-...739's
older bundles); if it was re-sold since, it has a newer latest deed and drops out (no stale merge).
This replaces a date cutoff, which would wrongly drop old-but-held bundles and keep recent-but-sold ones.

LINKED-SUCCESSOR GUARD — the latest-deed rule alone MISSES the shell game's signature move: buy
buildings together, then re-deed each into its own single-purpose LLC (each parcel's latest deed is
now a separate transfer, so the joint deed is "superseded" and dropped). We recover it: a superseded
joint deed still proves co-ownership between parcels Bi,Bj when the joint grantee G is the GRANTOR of
each parcel's latest deed (G restructured them) AND the successor LLC is a shell (globally the latest
grantee of <= SUCCESSOR_MAX buildings) AND that onward conveyance is a NOMINAL transfer (docamount
<= NOMINAL_MAX, i.e. a $0/token restructuring) — NOT a market-price sale. The nominal-consideration
check is what separates same-owner restructuring from an arms-length SALE to an independent buyer:
without it, a genuine $1.1M sale to a small (<= SUCCESSOR_MAX-building) buyer is indistinguishable
from a $0 re-deed into a controlled shell and gets falsely re-merged (the block-3498 / P0133 trap —
see specs/eval-protocol.md §3.2). Verified recovery (nominal consideration, DEED-ONLY, and a true
false-split vs REAL JustFix WoW): AXL HOME LLC bought two adjacent Flushing houses (43-58 & 43-60 164th
St) on one 2015 deed (2015120200784001, $1.2M) and in 2019 re-deeded each into its own shell at $0 —
43-58 -> BRIDGEWOOD DEVELOPMENT LLC (head officer Brian Lin), 43-60 -> HONG LI GROUP LLC (head officer
Xianglian Wang). They register to different people at different addresses, so WoW files them under two
UNRELATED portfolios (wow.wow_portfolios orig_id 14133 vs 55695); the shared deed + nominal recovery is
the SOLE link that reunites them (owner group OG-15928, CONNECTED_BY_DEED only). block-3498's assemblage,
sold off in real ($1.1M) arms-length deals to distinct buyers, stays split, as it should.

RECALL CAVEAT — the nominal gate is deliberately precision-first, and its recall cost is real, not
hypothetical: a same-owner restructuring recorded at a market-scale price (a transfer-tax or financing
basis) is dropped right alongside true arms-length sales, because price alone cannot tell them apart
(the §3 "restructuring vs. sale" check that needs human adjudication). The showcase 41 Haight bulk buy
is exactly this: nine of ten townhouses were re-deeded at ~$1.6-2.8M, so the gate declines the whole
set and NO Haight building is now in an owner group — a defensible precision call, but a recall miss
worth naming (see specs/case-haight.md and the measured impact + a candidate shared-principal
refinement in specs/deed-gate-review.md).

DEED-HUB CAP — a landlord on more than DEED_HUB_CAP distinct multi-parcel deeds is a serial co-investor
whose transitive links would over-merge unrelated parties (Aaron Feldman doing separate JVs with many
partners = the deed analogue of the aggregator megaoffice). Such hub nodes are dropped from the cliques
(precision-safe: drops edges, never adds a wrong one).

Scope: doctype ILIKE '%DEED%' (the 8 conveyance subtypes), 2..MAX_PARCELS lots (mega-deeds are
bulk/institutional transfers). Held-since branch also excludes public/affordable-housing AND broader
institutional conveyances (HPD/City/HDFC/program, plus university/state-agency/bank/foundation grantor
OR grantee) and co-op/condo buildings — shared deeds that fuse unrelated co-beneficiaries /
co-shareholders / institutional co-parties, not co-owners (see _HELD_KW = _HELD_PUBLIC_KW ∪ _INST_KW,
_COOP_CLASSES, and specs/deed-gate-review.md §5–§6). One clique per deed over the co-conveyed
buildings' landlord nodes (star above STAR_ABOVE to bound edges).

Node mapping is the same explode-join on ``bbl`` that splink_bridge/llc_edges use. Neo4j-free;
returns ``(src_nodeid, dst_nodeid, weight)`` so pipeline.py loads it as CONNECTED_BY_DEED.

# Institutional grantor/grantee terms BEYOND the housing-program names in _HELD_PUBLIC_KW — screened on
# BOTH party sides in the held-since guard (folded into _HELD_KW / _PUBLIC_LIKE below), the single source
# of truth shared by both held paths (_deed_sql and _JOINT_SQL).
#
# WHY — the institutional over-merge failure. _HELD_PUBLIC_KW is deliberately narrow (housing-program
# names), so it misses institutional conveyances: a single government->university land transfer, read as
# shared private ownership, fuses two unrelated operators into one giant owner group. Verified vs ACRIS
# (2026-09-18): joint held deed 2022011101555001 (2021, $3M, 16 parcels) conveyed NEW YORK STATE URBAN
# DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION -> TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY (Columbia's Manhattanville campus
# expansion); one Genevieve Outlaw building (~64-building Harlem cluster) and one Malcolm Punter building
# (~44) both passed through it, bridging the two into a false ~114-building "owner." Neither party
# matched _HELD_PUBLIC_KW and the parcels aren't co-op/condo, so it slipped the §5 guard. "URBAN
# DEVELOPMENT" catches the UDC grantor; "TRUSTEES OF" catches the Columbia grantee — so the deed is
# excluded on both sides.
#
# PRECISION-FIRST (verified against the merge-forming held set, 2026-09-18). These are DELIBERATELY NOT
# the bare terms in _INST_RE. As a substring LIKE on both party sides of every held deed, the bare
# institutional words each also swept up PRIVATE owners named for a street or a person — the same
# "nuke a private LLC / family trust" failure the design forbids for bare "TRUST"/"CORP":
#   - "UNIVERSITY" hit `1970 UNIVERSITY LLC` and `UNIVERSITY PLACE REALTY LLC` (University Ave / Pl);
#   - "CHURCH"     hit `97-99 CHURCH AVENUE REALTY LLC` (Church Ave);
#   - "FOUNDATION" hit `FOUNDATIONS DEVELOPMENT 822 LLC` (a developer);
#   - "TRUSTEES"   hit `ELEANOR SIMONETTI, AS CO-TRUSTEES` (a 7-parcel FAMILY trust — the worst case);
#   - "FANNIE"     hit the person `ZUCKER FANNIE`.
# So the collision-prone words are replaced by unambiguous anchors: "TRUSTEES OF" (catches "TRUSTEES OF
# COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY", never "AS CO-TRUSTEES"), "FANNIE MAE"/"FREDDIE MAC" (the GSEs, never a first
# name). "UNIVERSITY"/"COLLEGE"/"CHURCH"/"FOUNDATION" are dropped entirely (Columbia is already caught by
# URBAN DEVELOPMENT + TRUSTEES OF). Still NO bare "TRUST"/"CORP". "AUTHORITY" as a substring already
# subsumes DORMITORY / PORT AUTHORITY, and "BANK" matched only institutional lenders (US Bank, Chemical
# Bank, …) in the merge-forming set. Result: the Columbia/UDC over-merge is dropped with ZERO private
# false positives (see specs/deed-gate-review.md §6).

# HELD-SINCE PRECISION GUARD (branch A only). The held-since rule groups landlords whose buildings'
# LATEST deed is one shared multi-parcel deed. Two failure modes make that shared deed prove NOT
# private co-ownership but a shared *program* or *building form*, fusing unrelated people:
#   (1) Public / affordable-housing OR institutional conveyance — the linking deed's GRANTOR or
#       GRANTEE is a government / nonprofit housing entity (HPD/City/HDFC/a partnership program) OR a
#       broader institution (state agency, bank, hospital, a university via its board of trustees), so
#       its two grantees are co-*beneficiaries* / co-parties of an institutional transfer, not
#       co-owners. The pre-existing _INST filter only screened the GRANTEE side, so an HPD-as-grantor
#       conveyance TO two people slipped through — this screens both sides (partytype 1 AND 2). The
#       keyword set is the UNION _HELD_KW = _HELD_PUBLIC_KW ∪ _INST_KW: the narrow housing-program list
#       widened with the precision-tuned institutional terms, so a government->university transfer (NYS
#       UDC -> Columbia, deed 2022011101555001) no longer fuses two unrelated operators (the
#       Outlaw+Punter ~114-building over-merge; see _INST_KW). Still precision-first — no bare
#       TRUST/CORP/UNIVERSITY-style substrings that would nuke private street-named LLCs or family
#       trusts — so a person grantor sharing a member surname (family/estate co-ownership) is left
#       untouched, as it should be.
#   (2) Co-op / condo building — the parcel is owned by shareholders / unit-owners, not one landlord,
#       so its original/association deed fuses unrelated shareholders. See coop_condo.py: co-op/condo
#       buildings have no place in the ownership layer. We drop a held deed whose parcels are majority
#       co-op/condo (matching owner_groups.py's >50% building-level convention).
# See specs/deed-gate-review.md (held-since precision fix). Does NOT touch the linked-successor $0
